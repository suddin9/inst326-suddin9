This week I used AI to help with setting up github, I didn't know how to upload repository and I used chat gpt to figure out how to do it
I asked Ai the clear definition of how to use Arithmetic and Expressions, I understood it and still need a lot more work with python.
I asked chatgpt to show me examples, it's still a bit confusing but as I progress throught this semester it will get easier. 
THis is the link to my chat gpt Chat explaning me how to use github and explain to me what Arithmetic and Expressions is
